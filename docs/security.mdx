## Transport rules

- Same host: Unix sockets only, no transport auth/encryption.
- Gateway admin control-plane (including pairing trigger) runs only on local Unix sockets.
- Remote host: mTLS required; plain HTTP/WS runtime traffic is disallowed.

If you break this rule, remote components should fail closed.

## Gateway identity bootstrap

At setup, generate and persist gateway identity:
- `ed25519` keypair for signatures.
- Local pairing CA material (CA private key and CA certificate trust anchor for issued remote certs).
- Keep the private key local with strict filesystem permissions.
- Distribute the public key to remotes via operator config.

## Pairing trust

- Remotes must verify gateway-signed pairing initiation.
- Remotes must verify gateway-signed cert issuance payload before installing issued certs.
- Gateway must only connect to explicitly paired remotes.
- Runtime calls to remote tools must be denied until pairing is complete.
- Pairing is identity bootstrap only; runtime actions are still authorization-gated.

Current implementation caveat:
- Gateway URL-discovered tool hosts (`CRAB_GATEWAY_TOOL_HOST_URLS`) are currently direct HTTP(S) integrations and do not yet enforce pairing in that path. Treat them as trusted-infrastructure links and isolate accordingly.

## Authorization boundaries

- Listener: ingress write only.
- Subscriber: event stream read only.
- Tool host: callable methods gated by explicit policy.
- Paired CLI principals (`component_type=operator`) can use `cli_admin` policy for remote management.
- `cli_admin` does not grant remote pairing trigger; pairing initiation remains local admin-socket-only.

On remote traffic, mTLS peer identity must match a paired record.

Pairing trigger remains local-admin only, even for paired remote CLI management sessions.

## CLI auth bootstrap security

- Auth file defaults resolve to local `./.crabstack/auth/...` when local `./.crabstack` exists, otherwise to `~/.crabstack/auth/...`.
- `crab auth codex` stores credentials at `codex.json` in that auth directory.
- `crab auth anthropic` stores credentials at `anthropic.json` in that auth directory.
- `crab auth claude` stores setup-token credentials at `claude.json` in that auth directory.
- Credential files and parent directories should be owner-only permissions.
- Treat refresh tokens as long-lived secrets and rotate when compromise is suspected.

For role profiles, action namespaces, and lease behavior, see [Integration Peer Auth](./integrations/peer-auth.mdx).

## Provider auth states

Expect subscription-backed providers to move through:
- `valid`
- `expiring`
- `reauth_required`

Operate alerts around state changes before outages happen.

## Minimum security checks

1. Verify every remote endpoint is mTLS-only.
2. Verify every remote has a paired identity record.
3. Verify cert fingerprint and peer ID are present in remote event metadata.
4. Verify pairing triggers are not exposed on public HTTP/WS ingress.
5. Verify pairing CA files are durable and access-restricted under gateway key storage.
6. Verify least-privilege policies for listeners/subscribers/tool hosts.
