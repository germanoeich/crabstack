description: Operator-first guide to deploy, secure, pair, and run Crabstack components.

Crabstack runs a modular agent stack with a gateway at the center and optional services (memory, cron, Discord listener/consumer, and custom tool hosts).

Use this section when you are operating the system. Integration contracts and schemas live under [Integrations](./integrations/index.mdx).

## Start Here

1. Read [Overview](./overview.mdx) for component responsibilities and rollout shape.
2. Read [Security](./security.mdx) before exposing anything off-host.
3. Follow [Pairing](./pairing.mdx) to onboard tool hosts and other remotes.
4. Use [Cron Service](./cron.mdx) for scheduling and `cron.*` tool operations.
5. Use [Discord Listener](./discord.mdx) for Discord ingress and outbound response wiring.
6. Use [CLI Operations](./cli.mdx) for auth bootstrap, control-plane actions, and one-shot ingress.
7. Use [Tools](./tools.mdx) and [Events](./events.mdx) for runtime operations and troubleshooting.

## Operator defaults

- Keep gateway as the orchestration source of truth.
- Pair every pair-capable remote before runtime traffic.
- Use mTLS for all remote links.
- Keep cron/discord adapters observable (health checks + delivery error logs), not "best effort".
- Expect at-least-once event delivery and design ops around idempotency.
