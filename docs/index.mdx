description: Operator-first guide to deploy, secure, pair, and run Crabstack components.

Crabstack runs a modular agent stack with a gateway at the center and optional remote services (listeners, memory, cron, tool hosts).

Use this section when you are operating the system. Integration contracts and schemas live under [Integrations](./integrations/index.mdx).

## Start Here

1. Read [Overview](./overview.mdx) for component responsibilities and rollout shape.
2. Read [Security](./security.mdx) before exposing anything off-host.
3. Follow [Pairing](./pairing.mdx) to onboard tool hosts and other remotes.
4. Use [Tools](./tools.mdx) and [Events](./events.mdx) for operations and troubleshooting.

## Operator defaults

- Keep gateway as the orchestration source of truth.
- Pair every remote before runtime traffic.
- Use mTLS for all remote links.
- Expect at-least-once event delivery and design ops around idempotency.
