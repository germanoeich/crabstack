title: Pair a New Remote Tool Host
description: Operator runbook for securely pairing new remote components with the gateway.
---

Use this when onboarding a new remote component (tool host, listener, subscriber, provider).

For protocol-level message contracts, see [Integration Pairing Flow](./integrations/pairing.mdx).

## Preconditions

- Gateway identity keypair exists.
- Gateway admin Unix socket is reachable from the local CLI/operator context.
- Gateway pairing CA material exists (or is configured for first-time generation).
- Remote component is configured with `gateway_public_key_ed25519`.
- Remote endpoint is reachable and mTLS-ready for runtime traffic.
- You know component type and endpoint.

## Pairing command

```bash
crab pair tool wss://10.0.0.1:5225
```

Pairing is control-plane initiated through the gateway admin Unix socket. Gateway then opens the outbound remote session and marks pairing complete only after signature, challenge, CSR validation, and cert install confirmation pass.

## What happens during pairing

1. CLI/operator sends pairing request to the gateway admin Unix socket.
2. Gateway opens outbound handshake to remote and runs signed init + identity exchange.
3. Gateway sends encrypted challenge and validates challenge response.
4. Remote sends `pair.csr_request` with a signed CSR.
5. Gateway validates CSR and sends `pair.csr_issued` with issued cert + chain.
6. Remote installs cert and confirms with `pair.csr_installed`.
7. Gateway validates fingerprint confirmation and finalizes `pair.complete`.

## What success looks like

- Pairing completes without signature/challenge/CSR validation errors.
- Gateway persists remote identity metadata (component ID, keys, cert fingerprint, status).
- Subsequent `/v1/tools/*` traffic is accepted over mTLS.
- You see `pairing.completed` events for the requested endpoint.

## Common failures

- `SIGNATURE_INVALID`: wrong gateway public key configured on remote.
- `CHALLENGE_FAILED`: encryption/proof-of-possession mismatch.
- CSR validation/installation mismatch: malformed CSR or installed fingerprint mismatch.
- `TIMEOUT`: endpoint unreachable or handshake stalled.
- `UNREACHABLE`: transport or DNS/network issue.

## Operational advice

- Treat pairing as explicit inventory management, not auto-discovery.
- Keep paired records current (`last_seen_at`, status) and remove stale peers.
- Re-pair after key or cert rotation.
- Back up and protect pairing CA files; if CA changes, expect controlled re-pairing.
