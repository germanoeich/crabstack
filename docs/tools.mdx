title: Operate Remote Tools
description: How operators expose, pair, and run remote tool hosts safely.
---

Remote tools let gateway call external capabilities (memory, cron, or custom services).

For request/response schema details, see [Integration Tool Protocol](./integrations/tools.mdx).

## Tool host model

- Tool hosts expose discovery and call endpoints.
- Gateway is the caller and policy enforcer.
- Pairing is triggered through gateway local admin socket control-plane APIs.
- Pairing is mandatory before any runtime call is accepted.
- Pairing establishes identity, not full runtime capability; allow/deny policy still applies.

## Minimum controls

- Enforce mTLS for remote transport.
- Restrict callable methods by explicit policy.
- Set call timeouts per tool.
- Record calls with IDs for audit and replay.

## Reliability expectations

- Retries happen for transport failures and `retryable_error` outcomes.
- Side-effecting tools should return stable operation IDs.
- Idempotent tools must handle duplicate idempotency keys safely.

## Authorization expectations

- Default behavior is deny-by-default for remote actions.
- `tool_host` peers are expected to receive `tool.call.requested` and publish only `tool.call.completed` or `tool.call.failed`.
- Broader permissions require explicit peer policy overrides.
- Temporary leases can reduce scope for session-specific runtime flows but never expand beyond role + policy.

Policy and role contracts are detailed in [Integration Peer Auth](./integrations/peer-auth.mdx).

## Initial tool set

- Memory host: `memory.append`, `memory.query`, `memory.delete`
- Cron host: `cron.list`, `cron.create`, `cron.remove`

## Production checklist

1. Pair host and verify identity metadata.
2. Verify issued mTLS cert fingerprint matches paired record after install confirmation.
3. Confirm discovery (`/v1/tools`) returns expected schemas.
4. Validate timeout and retry behavior with failure injection.
5. Audit logs by `call_id` and `trace_id`.
