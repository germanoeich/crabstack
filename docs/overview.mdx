## What Pinchy is

Pinchy is a multi-tenant, file-configured agent runtime with durable sessions and pluggable services.

Core behavior:
- Gateway is the orchestration core.
- Listeners, memory, cron, and tool hosts can run as separate processes or on separate hosts.
- Gateway stores full turn history and long-lived sessions.
- Memory is external by default and can also expose callable tools.
- Pairing trigger is control-plane only and runs through the gateway admin Unix socket.

## Core components

- `gateway-core`: routing, sessions, turn execution, outbox/event dispatch.
- `ingress adapters` (`http`, `ws`): normalize inbound messages into the canonical event envelope.
- `admin socket adapters`: local control-plane operations (pairing and maintenance).
- `channel listeners`: platform adapters for Discord/WhatsApp/etc.
- `memory service`: subscriber ingest plus optional tool host.
- `cron service`: emits scheduled events and exposes `cron.*` tools.
- `pinchy-cli`: operator-side control-plane client through the admin socket.

## Operational model

- Strict ordering is enforced per session for turn-driving work.
- Subscriber delivery is eventual and at-least-once.
- Full history is stored, not summaries only.
- Config is YAML-driven and applied through validated tool flows with revision history.

## Multi-tenant guidance

Identity mapping is operator-defined. A practical runtime key is:
- `tenant_id + agent_id + platform + channel_id + actor_id`

Memory scoping is explicit:
- Use `isolation_key` when isolation is required.
- If omitted, scope falls back to global.

## Rollout order (recommended)

1. Stand up shared contracts and gateway persistence.
2. Enable HTTP ingress and basic routing.
3. Add model providers.
4. Pair and attach tool hosts (memory, cron).
5. Expand to additional listeners and WS ingress.
